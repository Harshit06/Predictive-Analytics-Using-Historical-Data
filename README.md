# 📈 Predictive Analytics Using Historical Data

A complete, end-to-end machine learning project that forecasts future trends from historical time-series data. It combines **regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest) and a **classical time-series model** (ARIMA) so you can compare approaches side by side, with a full pipeline for cleaning, feature engineering, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a realistic, production-style predictive analytics workflow:

- **Data preprocessing** — handling missing values, outliers, and irregular time gaps
- **Feature engineering** — calendar features, lag features, rolling statistics
- **Model training** — Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, ARIMA
- **Evaluation** — MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R² with a clear model comparison table
- **Visualization** — trend charts, seasonal decomposition, forecast vs actual, residual analysis, feature importance

It ships with a **synthetic historical sales dataset generator** so the project runs out-of-the-box — but it's built to be pointed at *any* historical dataset (sales, stock prices, website traffic, energy demand, weather, etc.) with minimal changes.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/predictive-analytics-project.git
cd predictive-analytics-project

# (Recommended) create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the full pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Generate a synthetic historical sales dataset (if one doesn't already exist in `data/`)
2. Clean and preprocess it
3. Engineer calendar, lag, and rolling-window features
4. Train Linear Regression, Random Forest, and ARIMA models
5. Evaluate all models and print a comparison table
6. Save charts to `outputs/plots/`
7. Save the best-performing model to `outputs/models/`

### Explore interactively
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/predictive_analysis.ipynb
```

### Run tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 🔧 Using Your Own Dataset

Replace `data/sample_sales_data.csv` with your own CSV — it just needs:
- A **date column** (any parseable date format)
- A **numeric target column** you want to forecast

Then update the column names in `main.py`:

```python
DATA_PATH = "data/your_dataset.csv"
TARGET_COL = "your_target_column"
```

And in `src/preprocessing.py`, adjust `load_data(path, date_col="your_date_column", ...)` if your date column isn't named `date`.

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model | Type | Why it's included |
|---|---|---|
| **Linear Regression** | Regression | Fast, interpretable baseline |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | Regression (ensemble) | Captures non-linear patterns, gives feature importance |
| **ARIMA** | Classical time-series | Models autocorrelation & trend directly from the series |

The pipeline evaluates all three on a **chronological train/test split** (no shuffling — critical for time series) and reports which one generalizes best.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) — average magnitude of errors
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) — penalizes larger errors more heavily
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) — error as a percentage, easy to communicate
- **R² Score** — proportion of variance explained by the model

---

## 📈 Sample Outputs

Running `main.py` generates the following charts in `outputs/plots/`. Once generated, they'll render right here in this README (on GitHub) since the images live inside the repo folder.

**1. Historical Trend** — raw historical trend
![Historical Trend](outputs/plots/01_historical_trend.png)

**2. Seasonal Decomposition** — trend / seasonality / residual breakdown
![Seasonal Decomposition](outputs/plots/02_seasonal_decomposition.png)

**3. Predictions vs Actual** — all models' forecasts vs actual values
![Predictions vs Actual](outputs/plots/03_predictions_vs_actual.png)

**4. Metric Comparison** — bar charts comparing MAE / RMSE / R²
![Metric Comparison](outputs/plots/04_metric_comparison.png)

**5. Feature Importance** — which features drive the Random Forest's predictions
![Feature Importance](outputs/plots/05_feature_importance.png)

**6. Residual Diagnostics** — where and how the model gets it wrong
![Residual Diagnostics](outputs/plots/06_rf_residuals.png)

> ⚠️ **Important:** These images only show up on GitHub *after* you run `python main.py` (which creates the PNG files) and then `git add`, `commit`, and `push` them. GitHub can't display an image that doesn't exist in the repo yet — run the pipeline first, then push.
